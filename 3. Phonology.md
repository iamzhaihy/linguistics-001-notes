##Phonology

- phonology is the study of the **representations** and **systematic structuring** of sounds in a language.
    -  as opposed to ponetics: phonetics deals with the *physical properties* of the sounds themselves rather than the *system* in which they are used
    -  understanding how sounds are **organized** in a language system
    -  what sounds are **distinctive** in a language ( = make different word meanings)
    -  how sounds **function** across languages
- **Phonemes** : 
   A phoneme is a speech sound that is **distinctive**.  (***contrastive + unpredictable***)
    - phonemes are "psychological" and "learned" （e.g infants are aware of all speech sounds, but they soon learn which ones are important and ignore the unimportant ones）
    - languages each have a unique set of speech sounds
        - Foreign accent: when we try to speak a foreign language using the sounds from our own language.
        - when we encounter a sound outside our set: probably hard to hear and produce
-  **Allophones** : 
    The speech realization of a phoneme (single skeletal unit). Variable pronounciations of a phoneme. (***not contrastive + predictable***)
    - do not make different word meanings.
    - one sound never **occurs** in the enviroments in which the other occurs 
      *(Clark Kent & Superman can **never** be in the same place at the same time)*
    - allophones are **contextually predictable**
      *(Superman is realized as Superman when there is danger. Otherwise, Superman is Clark Kent)*
- Allophone vs. Phoneme 

    | Allophone                  | Phoneme                  |
    | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
    | what speakers say          | abstract                 |
    | Non-contrastive            | contrastive              |
    | No minimal pairs           | can find minimal pairs   |
    | complementary distribution | contrastive distribution |
    | maybe free variation       |                          |

- The distribution  of sounds can be described in terms of a **phonological rule**
    - e.g. */p/ is aspirated at the beginning of a syllable and unaspirated following an /s/*.
