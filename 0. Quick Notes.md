## Quick Notes

- Written and spoken language are different, and linguists generally focus on spoken language as an object of study. (No one is more 'pure' than the other)

- In linguistics, we do not give value judgment to language varieties. (No 'good' or 'bad')

- Slang is considered linguistic innovation. Language change and evolution is considered a natural part of human nature.

- Being surrounded by spoken language is the only requirement for kids to learn their language fluently. (you don't have to go to school to learn a language.)

- The human brain has evolved to learn any language. (It is easier to learn Chinese if your ancestors are Chineseï¼ŸNo)

- English plurals:  what is the distribution of [s] and [z]? ("bugs" [bugz] vs. "cats" [cats])
  Answer: complementary distribution. There is a morpheme [-z] that has two variants [-z] and [-s], determined by the property of the sound in the word it attaches to.

- level of grammar: patterns over patterns.

- Words are not the smallest units of meaning. Morphemes are. Morphemes cannot be broken down any further and still have meaning. Morphemes have a consistent sound and consistent meaning.
