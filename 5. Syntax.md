## Syntax

- How can we identify the ***lexical categories?***   *e.g.*   Noun, verb, and adjective.

    - Lexical categories are identified by their patterns. Different categories have different patterns.

        (1) "*The* dax", dax is a noun.
        (2) "Is dax**ing**", dax seems to be a verb. 

- ***Syntax*** 

    - Identifying and describing the **patterns** of language *at a level larger than single words* 

    - The study of *how words and phrases are* **organized** *into larger phrases* 

        *e.g.*   Constituents (phrases)   Phrase-structure rules 

    - Instead of specific sentences, we learn **subconscious patterns** that allow us to *produce* and *understand* an **infinite** number of sentences. We call these subconscious patterns ***syntax***.

- ***Grammaticality*** = a speaker's knowledge of syntax. 

    - Colorless green ideas sleep furiously

        Sentence has no real meaning (***semantics***), but it is a well-formed English sentence (***syntax***)

    - *Furiously ideas green sleep colorless*.

        An ill-formed english sentence.

    - Speakers need to know (*subconciously*) two basic principles in order to construct proper sentences in their language.

    - Acceptable **linear order** of words.

    - **Consistuency** and **Hierarchical** structure.

- **Syntactic ambiguity**. The following sentence is **structurally ambiguous** :

    - I saw **[the mouse with binoculars]**  vs.  I saw **[the mouse\] [with binoculars]** 

- **Syntactic constituents** refer to *groups* of words/morphemes in an utterance that form a **unit**. Words are organized into **constituents** (or **phrases**).

    - *e.g.*   [The mouse\] [ate [the cheese] ].

    - Sentences have **two** principle constituents, namely, **NP** and **VP**. A sentence is made up of a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase.

    - Phrase structure **rules** (similar to the **phonological rules**) : 

        *NP —> (Determiner) (Adjective) Noun (Prepositional Phrase)*

        *VP —> Verb (NP) (PP)*;                         *PP —> Preposition (NP)*

- Ways to code the **grammatical relations** (maybe use combination of these) :

    - *Word Order* :  The dog bits the cat.

    - *Inflectional morphology on nouns* : ジョン**が**　メアリー**に**　ほん**を**　あげた。

        John-**NOM**  Mary-**ACC**   Book-**DAT**. The *preffered* word order is SOV, but can be **flexible**.

        **Nominative** marks the subject, **accusative** marks the object, and **dative** marks the indirect object.

    - *Inflectional morphology on verbs* :  Com**o**, Com**es** ...
