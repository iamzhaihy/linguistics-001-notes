## Morphology

- ***Morphology*** : the study of how **words** are formed (the study of word - **making** and word - **marking**)

- ***Lexicon*** is the **mental dictionary** containing **all** the productive morphemes in our language (*every* language has it). It has a large number of words availabe for its users to choose from.

- A ***morpheme*** is the **smallest form-meaning** unit in a language.

    - inter-na-tion-al

    - "dogs"  = dog + z (two dogs)

        "dog's" = dog + z (the dog's tail)

        "*dog*s"  = dog + z (he dogs me constantly)

    - 2 distinct phonological forms & 5 morphemes !

- If a word contains **only one** morpheme, it is a ***root***. Root is the **main morpheme** to which another morpheme(s) is added. 

    - *e.g.*   Beauty (*root*) + ful (*suffix*)

    If a word already contains **more than one** morpheme, it is a ***stem***. Stem is a **complex** morpheme to which another morpheme is added.

    - *e.g.*   Beautiful (*stem*) + ly (*suffix*).


- How to ***categorize*** morphemes?

  - **Inflectional** morphemes vs. **Derivational** morphemes

    - A *Inflectional* morpheme : 

        (1) ***code the relationship between consitituents of a phrase***. 
        (2) **does not** change the meaning.  
        (3) creates different **grammatical** forms 
        (4) conveys **syntactic** meaning about words.

        *e.g.*  plural, tenses

    - *Derivational* morphemes changes the **central meaning** or **lexical category** of the word.

        (1) Walk-er : Verb to Noun
        (2) Cat-ty : Noun to Adj.
        (3) Re-paint : meaning changed
        (4) Happi-ness : Adj. to Noun.
        (5) Quick-ly: Adj. to Adv. 


  - **FREE** morphemes vs. **BOUND** morphemes

    - a *free* morpheme can **stand alone**.   *e.g.*   dog, for

    - a *bound* morpheme must be **attached** to another morpheme.   *e.g.*  " -ing ", " re- ", " -s "

      Bound morphemes are also known as " ***affixes*** ". Two special types :

      - *infix* : attaches **inside a stem**.   *e.g.* un-***bloody***-believable
      - *circumfix* : attaches **around a stem**.   *e.g.* ***a***-fish-***in'***

  - **Grammatical** morphemes vs. **Lexical** morphemes

    - *Grammatical* (or **functional**) morphemes serve a function in the utterance: 

        *e.g.*   John ***is*** go***ing*** ***to the*** store ***for the third*** time.

        **Function** words contain **grammatically relevant** information, does **NOT** have semantic content or refer to things in the world. **Closed class** : rarely add words to this class.

    - *Lexical* (or **content**) morphems have meaning.

        *e.g.*   ***Bill watch***es all his ***favorite show***s on ***Mondays***.

        **Content** words have **concrete** meaning, carry semantic content, refer to something out there in the world. **Open class** : can add words to this class all the time 

- 6 major ways to form new words from old words :

    (1) compounding
    (2) acronym
    (3) back-formation
    (4) abbreviation
    (5) eponym
    (6) blending
