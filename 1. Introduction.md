## Introduction

### Human Language:

- linguistic competence vs. linguistic performance

    you can think of linguistic competence as a person's unseen potential to speak a language (stored in your mind), while the linguistic performance is the observable realization of that potential (revealed in your speech): our performance is what we do with our competence. (File 1.2.1, page 7)

    **competence cannot be observed.**

- ***Five hallmarks*** of human language:

    1. **Arbitrariness**
        
        - Language is a system of arbitrary signs. It is generally recognized that the words of a language represent a connection between a group of **sounds and signs** (which give the word its *form*) and a **meaning** (which the form can be said to represent). Form + meaning = linguistic sign. This connection is typically ***arbitrary***.

        -  Some evidence: 

            (1) *cross-linguistic comparisons*. Words with the same meaning often have different forms in different languages (名字 vs. Name), and similar forms usually express different meanings.   

            (2) *names for inventions and products*. For example, when naming a car, a person only think of the sounds he/she likes, but will not be constrained by the nature of the car.

        - Rare representational (iconic) words:

            - **Onomatopoeia**:
                There are also some non-arbitrary aspects to language. **Onomatopoeic** words are imitative of natural sounds or have meanings that are associated with such sound of nature.  However, argument of arbitrariness can also be found (e.g. table at p.24).

            - **Sound symbolism**:
                Some words, or parts of words, more abstractly suggest the physical characteristics by the way they sound (e.g.  *glisten, gleam, glare, glimmer, glow, glitter*).

            - However, both of these are *still somewhat arbitrary*.

    2. **Discreteness**

        The property of language that allow us to combine together **discrete units** in order to create larger communicative units is called discreteness (e.g. English only about 50 sounds, but we can combine a very small number of sounds to form a large number of meaningful words). 

    3. **Duality of patterning**
            1. Lower level - elemental sounds carry no meaning. 
            2. Higher level - they can be combined in a wide variety of ways to create many different meanings.
    
    4. **Displacement**
    
        We can talk about things and events that are not present in space or time while we are communicating (e.g. courses taken last year, friend in other states, fictional characters).
    
    5. **Productivity**
    
        Productivity refers to a language's capacity for novel messages to be built up out of discrete units.
     
        We can produce and understand an almost infinite number of messages by combining relatively few elements and patterns


### Animal vs Human Communication

- What can we conclude about animal language?

    - Many animals can learn to *use signs* to stand for things (Chimp Washoe learned 132 ASL signs). 

    - Some may be able to learn *rudimentary grammar* (some dolphins appear to have learned rudimentary grammar).

    But even a five-year-old human’s language appears to be much more advanced.

- What makes human language different?

    - it not only has ***lexical items***

        *Nouns, verbs, adjectives*

    - but half of words in typical human speech are purely ***grammatical items***.

      *Prepositions, conjunctions, articles, auxiliary verbs*

- Linguistics is : 

    - scientific study of **natural** human language (some languages, such as *Latin*, are considered "dead" because people do not use them any more).

    - **empirical**. It relies on or derives from observation. 

        Language as scientific data to be analyzed objectively.

    - study of language structure and language use = **grammar**

    - is about ***descriptive*** grammar, **not** about *prescriptive* grammar.

    - **objective**. Linguistics is a study of language without judgment.

- Some facts about languages:

    - Only *5.5%* of languages have more than 1 million speakers.
    - *55%* of languages have fewer than 10,000 speakers.
    - *94%* of the world's population speak only *6%* of its languages.
