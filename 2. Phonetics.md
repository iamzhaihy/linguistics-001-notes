## Phonetics

- Sound is a **disturbance** in air that radiates outward from a source (when it hits our ear drums, we have heard a sound). Technically, **every sound is different**, but we can categorize the sounds.

- Phonetics: The study of the ***physical properties*** of speech sounds.

- IPA has a **single** symbol for **each** speech sound, and it is supposed to contain enough symbols to describe **all of speech sounds** used in all of the world's languages.

- Speech sounds **with** an obstruction at some point along the vocal tract are called ***consonants***.

    Speech sounds **with no** obstruction along the vocal tract are called ***vowels***.

- ***Diphthongs*** are vowels that are actually composed of 2 separate vowel sounds (e.g.  /ai/ l***ie***, /au/ h***ow***)

- **Broad** transcription is when a passage is transcribed with only a minimal amount of detail.

  **Narrow** transcription is when a passage is transcribed in as much detail as possible (it encodes more information about the **phonetic variations** of the specific allophones in the utterance).

- **Articulation** is basically a process by which a very basic buzzing (or hissing if voiceless) sound gets shaped by the vocal tract into very complicated sounds.

- When *vocal folds* are fully open, we breathe normally. When these are fully closed, we hold our breath.

- **Voiceless sounds** occur when the vocal cords are *held apart* so that air can pass through easily.
   **Voiced sounds** occur when the vocal cords are held tightly enough to not allow air to pass easily, but not so tightly that air can’t pass at all.


- Since consonants are created by an obstruction at some point along the vocal tract, they are usually described by *three pieces of information* :
    - The **place along the vocal tract** at which the obstruction occurs.
    - The **manner** in which the obstruction is created by the articulator.
    - Whether they are **voiced or not**.

 - Place of articulation

    | Place           | Meaning                                  |
    | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
    | *Bilabial*      | the two lips                             |
    | *Labiodental*   | the upper teeth and lower lip            |
    | *Dental*        | the tongue and the teeth                 |
    | *Alveolar*      | the tongue tip and alveolar              |
    | *Post-alveolar* | tongue tip and the palate just beyond the alveolar ridge |
    | *Palatal*       | tongue body and the palate               |
    | *Velar*         | tongue body and velum (soft palate)      |
    | *Glottal*       | the glottis                              |

 - Manner of articulation

    | Manner               | Feature                                 |
    | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
    | *Stops* or *plosive* | produced by stopping the airflow using the lips, teeth, or palate, followed by a sudden release of air.                 |
    | *Nasals*             | produced by the breath resonating in the nose                                       |
    | *Fricatives*         | involve a partial constriction at some point of the vocal tract + hissing sound |
    | Affricate            | a stop + fricative sequence made at the similar point of articulation |
    | *Approximant*        | involve less closure than stops and fricatives but more than a vowel. |
    | Lateral Approximant  | a special class of approximants which include sounds like /l/ in English |

- Vowels don’t have obstructions and they are **always voiced**. They are described in terms of the ***position of the tongue*** (*height* and *frontness*) and the ***rounding of the lips*** (*rounded* or *unrounded*).
    - **Height** : low/mid/high
    - **Back/Frontness** : front/central/back
    - **Rounding**: rounded/unrounded
