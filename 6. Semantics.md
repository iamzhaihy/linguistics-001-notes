## Semantics

- ***Semantics*** is the study of **meaning**. It is the study of *systematic* ways in which languages structure meaning, especially in **words and phrases**.

- **Lexicalization** is the process of turning a concept into a word.

    - kkita (*Korean*) : "to put together tightly"

- ***Semantic roles*** express meaning relationships between phrases in an utterance.

    "**The dog** licked **the cat**."

    | The dog | The cat |                 |
    | :-----: | :-----: | :-------------: |
    | Subject | Object  | syntactic roles |
    |  Agent  | Patient | semantic roles  |

    - **Syntactic roles** = the grammatical role that a noun phrase has in a **sentence**.

    - **Semantic role** = the role that a noun phrase has in the **event/action**.

        the way a referent noun **contributes** to the *state/action/situation* in a phrase

- ***Semantic Roles***

    | Agent       | doer of an action                        | *Jack* broke the window          |
    | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
    | Patient     | **change of state**/directly affected    | I cleaned the **car**            |
    | Experiencer | NP receiving **sensory** input           | **Tom** feels/smells/likes       |
    | Instruments | **means** by which an event is carried.  | Tom cut the bread with **knife** |
    | Causes      | **natural force** that brings about a change. | **The snow** caved in the roof.  |
    | Recipients  | NP receiving a **physical object**       | He brought **me** a book         |
    | Benefactive | NP **for** which an action is performed  | He bought a car for **me**       |
    | Locatives   | the **location** of an action or state.  | I live in **Davis**              |
    | Temporal    | the **time** at which the action/state occur | She left home **yesterday**      |

- **Referent** is the entity in the **external world** to which a linguistic expression relates.

    - **real world thing** that an utterance refers to (also *fictional characters*)

        **Sense** is the **meaning** of an expression by virtue of how it is said. 

    - **mental conception** of the thing the utterance refers to(a phrase can have *many* senses)

        These are two **aspects** (somewhat independent) of linguistic meaning.


- Words, meanings and concepts **do not** exist in isolation. They may depend on many factors, including features of **context**. They are related to *human uses and social norms*.
  
  | Term          | Meaning       |
  | ------------- | ------------- |
  | Hyponym  | subset (a word of more specific meaning than a general or superordinate term applicable to it) |
  | Hypernym | superset (a word with a broad meaning constituting a category under which more specific words fall) |
  | Synonym  | a word or phrase that means the same as another word or phrase in the same language |
  | Antonymy  | a word opposite in meaning to another |
  | Homophony | having the same pronunciation as another but different meaning, origin, or spelling |
  | Polysemy  | the coexistence of many possible meanings for a word or phrase |


- ***Deixis*** is the marking of the **orientation** or **position** of entities and events with respect to certain points of reference. They require **context** to be understood.
    - *Person* deixis : I, she, he, they etc
    - *Spatial* deixis : Here, there, this, that etc
    - *Temporal* deixis : Yesterday, tomorrow, before, after etc
